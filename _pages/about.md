Welcome to my homepage! I'm Tabitha, and I work as a data scientist, biostatistics PhD, and writer. With 6 years of experience consulting with clinical collaborators and leading the data science component of health-related research projects, my specialty is communicating accessible, interpretable results to cross-functional teams. I'm a team player, which means I am most productive and most energized by interdisciplinary collaboration. Checkout out my [publications page](https://tabpeter.github.io/publications/) to see my peer-reviewed work. My technical expertise is in developing scalable R/C++ software packages to analyze high-dimensional data. In other words, identifying predictive signals from datasets with many features is my professional focus. I've contributed to two published R/C++ packages, [plmmr](https://github.com/pbreheny/plmmr) (as lead developer) and [biglasso](https://github.com/pbreheny/biglasso) (as co-developer).
