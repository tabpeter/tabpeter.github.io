I'm Tabitha Peter, and I work as a biostatistician and writer. A lot of my work experience has been in consulting with doctors and medical professionals, leading the data science component of health-related research projects. My professional focus is communicating accessible, interpretable results to people with expertise outside of statistics. Several of my projects are explained more in detail [here](https://tabpeter.github.io/projects/).

I mentioned I am a writer - to see my peer-reviewed work, checkout out my [publications page](https://tabpeter.github.io/publications/). I have also written software, including contributions to two published R/C++ packages, [plmmr](https://github.com/pbreheny/plmmr) (as lead developer) and [biglasso](https://github.com/pbreheny/biglasso) (as co-developer). Beyond writing technical pieces and statistical software, I keep a diary and write poetry.

I'm currently located in Nashville, TN Metro area. If you'd like to collaborate or contact me, please email me at [tabitha.peter15\@gmail.com](mailto:tabitha.peter15@gmail.com).
