Dentists sought to understand the factors influencing the lifespan of tooth crown repairs, particularly the role of various dental materials. My contribution involved addressing the critical need for evidence-based insights by extracting and analyzing complex data from electronic health records. I collaborated closely with both the dental researchers and IT specialists to curate a robust dataset, meticulously validating the "time-to-event" outcome critical for this study. Through careful statistical modeling and rigorous data analysis, I generated a comprehensive report. The findings provided compelling evidence that dental material significantly impacts crown longevity, revealing that some materials are associated with a **1.5 to 2 times higher probability of needing re-intervention**. These crucial results were subsequently published in an open-access dental journal ([Jain et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.adaj.2021.08.012)), directly empowering dentists to make informed, evidence-based decisions in their practice, ultimately leading to improved oral health outcomes for patients.
