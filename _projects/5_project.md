## Context and motivation

Clinical professionals (e.g., dentists, doctors, nurses) need an understanding of statistical principles in order to critically read and correctly interpret findings in their fields of interest. In order to create accessible materials that prepare dentists for reading and interpreting quantitative research results, the [International Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Implants](https://www.quintessence-publishing.com/deu/en/journal/the-international-journal-of-oral-maxillofacial-implants) (IJOMI) has published a series of tutorial-style articles for its readers. Written with examples from real clinical practice, these tutorials have covered topics that range from how to collect data to interpreting survival analysis results.

## My contributions

I have had the privilege to contribute 3 tutorials in collaboration with my colleagues at the U. Iowa College of Dentistry: a tutorial on time-to-event analysis, a tutorial on meta-analysis, and a tutorial on data collection.
